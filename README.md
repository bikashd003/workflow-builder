# Workflow Builder

## Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to visually create and execute workflows for basic data manipulation tasks. Users can drag and drop workflow nodes onto the canvas to build their desired workflow, connect nodes to define the execution order, save and load previously created workflows, and receive visual feedback on workflow execution progress.
